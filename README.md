Introduction
Python is a powerful and versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Throughout my journey of learning Python, I have created several projects that have helped me gain a deeper understanding of the language and its various applications. This repository is a testament to my progress and showcases the projects I have completed.

Projects
Here is an overview of the projects included in this repository:

Project 1: This project introduces the fundamentals of Python, covering topics such as variables, data types, loops, and conditionals. It includes simple programs to demonstrate these concepts.

Project 2: In this project, I delve into object-oriented programming (OOP) using Python. I explore classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation through practical examples and exercises.

Project 3: This project focuses on file handling and data manipulation. I demonstrate how to read from and write to files, parse CSV and JSON data, and perform data analysis using Python libraries like Pandas.

Project 4: Here, I showcase my understanding of web scraping using Python. I create scripts to extract data from websites, demonstrating various techniques such as using BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

Project 5: In this project, I explore database connectivity with Python. I demonstrate how to connect to databases, perform CRUD operations, and interact with data using popular database libraries like SQLite and MySQL.

Project 6: This project showcases my knowledge of Python web development. I create a simple web application using frameworks such as Flask or Django, focusing on routing, templates, and database integration.

These projects are just a glimpse of what I have accomplished while studying Python. Each project contains detailed documentation and explanations to help you understand the concepts and techniques employed.
