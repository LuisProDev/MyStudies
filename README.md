My Python Projects Repository
Welcome to my Python Projects Repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of all the Python projects I have created and used to study and improve my Python programming skills. Each project focuses on different aspects of Python and covers a wide range of topics, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

### Projects
Here is an overview of the projects included in this repository:

Project 1 - 12: These projects introduce the fundamentals of Python, covering topics such as variables, data types, loops, and conditionals. It includes simple programs to demonstrate these concepts.

Project 12 - ?: In these projects, I delve into object-oriented programming (OOP) using Python. I explore classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation through practical examples and exercises.
