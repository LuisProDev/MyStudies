All the projects that I used to study Python

Project 1
Tip Calculator:
This is a tip calculator program that calculates the amount each person should pay for a bill. It asks for the total bill amount, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people splitting the bill. It then calculates the tip, adds it to the total bill, divides the result by the number of people, and displays the amount each person should pay. The program asks if the user wants to repeat the calculation or exit.
